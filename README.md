# Study the propagation of elastic waves in the Earth using Pluto notebooks
[Reactive Pluto Notebooks](https://pawbz.github.io/ES218.jl/) to demonstrate key concepts in seismology.

Pluto is a notebook system written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/).
This is a collection of [Reactive Notebooks](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/) that help demonstrate key concepts in seismology. These notebooks are developed to assist the course on Introduction to Seismology (ES218; August 2022). The idea is that the student, even with minimal programming knowledge, should be able to interact with these notebooks and develop intuition on wave phenomena. In addition to interactivity, another important feature is that these standalone notebooks contain all the necessary mathematics, where the expressions are manipulated using [Symbolics.jl](https://symbolics.juliasymbolics.org/dev/), a modern Computer Algebra System (CAS).
